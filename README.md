#The first project is about taking an input expression from the user in the format of opening and closing parenthesis.

#The program is based on stack. Stack package available in java is used to push the expression in the stack whenever the opening parenthesis is encountered.

#Pop operation is performed whenever the closing parenthesis is encountered. If after scanning the complete expression, it is found that the stack elements are completely popped.

#A message is displayed that the 'given expression is a balance bracket expression'. Otherwise, 'not a balance bracket expression' message is displayed.

#The Scanner and Stack packages can be imported using the following commands:
#import java.util.Stack;
#import java.util.Scanner;

The second project insert the elements in a binary search tree (BST) and takes any number from the user as a input.
The algorithm then search the pair of nodes in the BST whose sum is equal the inputted number.
